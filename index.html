		<b>Question1:</b><i> see code (html, javascript, and css) for comments</i> 
		<p><b>Question2:</b> The JS script loads at the end of the page in order to allow the HTML page and style elements to load.  </p>
		<p><b>Question3:</b> The onload function essentially means that the program waits until the page has been loaded. This means it ways until the HTML styling elements have loaded before running the script.  </p>
		<p><b>Question4:</b> The cityPop variable is an array. It features string elements, as well as numbers (integers)(for population counts). This array ressembles a list in python. It also is similar to a python dictionary, however I believe it is more of a list. In Javascript it is called an array however</p>
